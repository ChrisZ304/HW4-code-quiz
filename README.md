# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Task

In order to practice for future interviews and/or potential job related assessments, we were to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, as an internet based app. In creating the app, we practiced utilizing interactive JavaScript code to create dynamic and responsive multi-faceted webpages.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a 15 second timer starts and I am presented with a set of questions
WHEN I answer each question and click the next button
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I fail to answer the question within the time limit
THEN I am no longer able to select an answer and the question is marked as incorrect
WHEN all questions are answered 
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I recieve a final score based on the number of correctly answered questions.
WHEN I am presented with my final score
THEN I am given the option to restart the quiz or to exit
```

## Summary
I found this assignment extremley challenging. I went back and forth between multiple ways in which to go about createing it. I struggled with the conditionals for some reason mostly, but was finally able to piece the logic together correctly. 
As much as I struggled with the assignment, I also enjoyed it and am happy with my end result. I hoep to go back in the future and add to this to make the app more complex as well as increase the difficulty of the actual quiz.
